			<h4> Comment throughly. </h4>
				<p> Commenting in the code is great. It helps you remember what your thoughts were at the time of writting and why you wrote your code in that particular way. And it doesn't just help you, but anyone who might come in after you to add or change code.</p>

			<h4> Have Confidence </h4>
				<p> No matter how little you think you know about web development you know more than you did yesterday. Sure everyone
					else may seem like they are making leaps and bounds ahead of you, but if you are presistant you will be there soon enough.</p>
